# Vue 3 + Vite + Auto imported pages and components + layouts + PWA + Typescript

This is my updated boilerplate for Vue 3 and Vite. It comes with PWA and SSG along with my favourite featues from Nuxt, auto imported components and auto generated routes. Just install and get to work. ðŸš€

```bash
npx degit devJasonClarke/vue-vite-template-v2 name-of-your-project
